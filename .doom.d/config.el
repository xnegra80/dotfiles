;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "VictorMono Nerd Font" :size 15)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "VictorMono Nerd Font" :size 15)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "VictorMono Nerd Font" :size 24)

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
